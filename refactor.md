## Current Architecture Analysis

### **Pipeline Structure**
The pipeline runs 4 functions sequentially:
1. `fetch_ohlc` - Fetches OHLC data from external API
2. `compute_signals` - Calculates EMA values 
3. `compute_ema_trend` - Computes 9-30 EMA trends and crossovers
4. `populate_strategy_9_30_ema` - Creates final strategy table

### **Efficiency Issues for 50-100 Stocks**

#### **1. Sequential Processing Bottleneck**
- **Current**: Each function waits for the previous to complete
- **Problem**: With 50-100 stocks, this creates a significant bottleneck
- **Impact**: 5-minute intervals may not be sufficient for complete processing

#### **2. Redundant Data Processing**
- `compute_signals` processes ALL stock/timeframe pairs every run
- `compute_ema_trend` processes ALL pairs every run  
- `populate_strategy_9_30_ema` rebuilds the entire strategy table
- **Problem**: Most data doesn't change between 5-minute intervals

#### **3. Inefficient Database Operations**
- Multiple individual API calls per stock/timeframe
- No batching optimization for large datasets
- Redundant timestamp checks and data fetching

#### **4. Memory and Performance Issues**
- Loading entire datasets into memory
- No pagination for large result sets
- Potential timeout issues with 50-100 stocks

## **Recommended Optimizations**

### **1. Incremental Processing** - done
Instead of processing everything every 5 minutes:
- Only process stocks with new OHLC data
- Use timestamps to track what's been processed
- Implement delta processing for signals and trends

### **2. Parallel Processing Where Possible** - done
- Process stocks in parallel within each function
- Use Promise.all() for independent operations
- Implement worker queues for heavy computations

### **3. Database Optimizations**
- Use batch operations instead of individual calls
- Implement proper indexing on timestamp columns
- Use materialized views for complex aggregations
- Cache frequently accessed data

### **4. Smart Scheduling**
- Separate high-frequency (5min) and low-frequency (hourly) operations
- Use different schedules for different data types
- Implement priority queues for critical data

### **5. Data Structure Improvements**
- Store incremental updates instead of full rebuilds
- Use event-driven architecture for real-time updates
- Implement proper data versioning

## **Specific Recommendations**

### **For 50-100 Stocks:**
1. **Split the pipeline**: Run `fetch_ohlc` every 5 minutes, others hourly
2. **Parallel processing**: Process stocks in batches of 10-20 concurrently
3. **Incremental updates**: Only process new data since last run
4. **Caching layer**: Cache intermediate results to avoid recomputation

### **For Multiple Timeframes:**
1. **Separate processing**: Different timeframes can be processed independently
2. **Priority system**: 5-min data gets priority over hourly data
3. **Resource allocation**: Allocate more resources to high-frequency operations

### **For Additional Signals:**
1. **Modular architecture**: Each signal type as separate function
2. **Dependency management**: Clear dependency graph between signals
3. **Conditional processing**: Only run dependent functions when needed

The current implementation will **not scale efficiently** to 50-100 stocks with 5-minute intervals. You'll need significant architectural changes to handle the increased load while maintaining data consistency and processing speed.
